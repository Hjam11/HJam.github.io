title: "Stable Isotope Comparison of Soil and Saprolite Waters Extracted via Centrifugation and Cryogenic Vacuum Distillation"

excerpt: 'Water stable isotope characterization is a central tool in ecohydrology. Recent research highlights that selecting water extraction methods from soil samples substantially impacts data interpretation. Here, we compare waters in soil and saprolite extracted via centrifugation at different water potentials to the composition of residual water (post centrifugation) extracted via cryogenic vacuum distillation. Five pits were sampled at 10 cm increments to 1.5 m across an experimental hillslope in the Northern California Coast Ranges. The site is steep, north-facing, with a mixed hardwood and conifer canopy dominated by old-growth Douglas Fir...'
