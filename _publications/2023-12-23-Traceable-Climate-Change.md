excerpt: 'Climate change impacts on the Northeastern United States are expected to make the region more temperate overtime, with warmer winters, less total snowfall, and more rainfall. While this muting of extreme colds and snow is expected to make the region more temperate, the shift from decreasing snowfall to increasing rainfall has led to noticeable changes in hydro-biogeochemical dynamics in regional watersheds. Within this region lies the Finger Lakes, a series of 11 lakes carved out during the last glacial maximum. These lakes are particularly susceptible to increased rainfall amounts, particularly extreme events, due to the extensive gorge network and sharp topography of the landscape which favors enhanced soil erosion and nutrient fluxes into the lakes...'
