Abstract
---
Wildfires can produce large plumes of smoke that are transported across vast distances, altering
nutrient cycling of undisturbed watersheds exposed downwind. To date, wildfire smoke influence on
stream biogeochemical signatures remains an important knowledge gap. Here we evaluate the
impacts of wildfire smoke on phosphorus (P) biogeochemical cycling in a temperate watershed in the
Finger Lakes Region of Central New York located downwind from record setting Canadian forest res
during the summer of 2023. Daily sampling of stream and rainwaters was conducted over the 2 month
smoke period, generating a robust geochemical dataset. Stream dissolved P showed high sensitivity
to smoke events, attaining concentrations 2–3× greater than the pre-smoke period. Subsequent rain
events after smoke deposition were identified as a potentially important factor in magnitude and timing
of dissolved P responses. These findings demonstrate the capacity for wild re smoke to trigger rapid,
observable changes to stream P chemistry.
