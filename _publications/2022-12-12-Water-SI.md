excerpt: 'Interpretation of water flowpaths through the critical zone is aided by stable isotope analysis of waters accessed from soils, groundwater, and streamflow. However, little is known about how water isotope composition evolves along flowpaths from soil to stream, particularly when passing through weathered bedrock. Here, we use novel sampling capabilities to reveal that waters transiting through a deeply weathered, forested hillslope in northern California show seasonal dynamics many meters beneath soils...'
