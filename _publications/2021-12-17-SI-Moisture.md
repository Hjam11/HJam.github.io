title: "What is the Stable Isotope Moisture Record Generated in Soils and Shallow Saprolite Across a Seasonal Wet-up and Dry-down Cycle in a Mediterranean Climate?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-12-17AGU
excerpt: 'In a Mediterranean climate, subsurface moisture cycles through a winter wet-up followed by an extended period of summer dry-down during which evaporation, root uptake, and some progressive drainage reduce plant-available moisture to an end-of-summer residual level. The offset between the timing of precipitation supply and evaporative demand presents an ideal opportunity to document the isotopic evolution of plant-available and residual moisture...'
