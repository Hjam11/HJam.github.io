excerpt: 'Identifying the water sources used by plants is central to understanding potential shifts in water cycling with climate change. Using the stable isotope composition of water for this purpose is contingent on the accurate characterization of potential water sources and the isotope composition of plant waters too. However, open questions remain about the most appropriate water extraction methods for isotope characterization of water. In this study, we leveraged extensive hydrologic monitoring and stable isotope characterization across an experimental hill slope in the California Coast Ranges to evaluate the impacts of xylem water extraction methods on tree water source identification...'
