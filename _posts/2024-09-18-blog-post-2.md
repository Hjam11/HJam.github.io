It's funny how you can have so many thoughts about a race but once you go to write them down, you have no clue what to say. Virgil Crest Ultras was a race I signed up for kind of last minute (about 2 to maybe 3 weeks out of race day), but had been on my radar for about 2 months. I was looking for a race to use in my build up for Rio Del Lago in November to test my overall fitness and see if I was still on track for my goals. Virgil Crest 50 fit this aim for a few reasons. One, it's about 6 weeks out from Rio Del Lago. I felt that this gave me a good shot to push myself with ample time to recover should I blow up at the race and need more time to entirely recoup. Two, I haven't 'raced' an ultra marathon or even a marathon since I started grad school. Putting myself back into a position to race before Rio felt important to shake out the cobwebs and to (hopefully) gain some confidence. Third, and somewhat related to two, I often times feel like I don't even know what I'm doing when it comes to setting my goals and shooting for them when it comes to running. Maybe I just lack confidence, but I have no clue how hard it is to run 100 miles in 18 hours. To be honest, that goal for Rio felt fast, ambitious, but attainable (a 'goal' if you will lol). I don't know if it is going to be a stretch with my fitness to run that time or if that is well within my wheelhouse. My goals for both Rio and Virgil revolve around time, but those times historically have lead to podium finishes at both of these events. That intimidates me. I don't think of myself as a very fast runner. A quick runner, yes, but out of my element when competing with those going for podiums and wins. It is a different mentality to compete against other runners than it is to solely compete against yourself.

Because of this, I was incredibly nervous heading into Virgil Crest. I wanted to finish between 10 to 11 hours, which would not only place me on the podium, but most likely give me a chance at winning the race. I'm still not sure if I was more nervous for going against competition, or if it's more that being in the front of the pack can be a bit isolating. I knew at some point in this race I was going to suffer, but the idea of suffering alone for 50 miles was daunting. To be brief, I luckily didn't have to suffer alone for most of the race; and, I left the race a lot more confident for Rio Del Lago than I was heading into Virgil. There's a lot I think I should be proud of with Virgil Crest, and a lot I should be weary of with regards to Rio Del Lago. I'll try and break the race down into sections:

# Virgil Crest

Virgil Crest Ultras hosted by Nichole and Vinny from Happily Running is a burly race no matter what distance you run. There are options from 10k up to 100 miles (161 km). I know I am missing a piece of the history of the course, but the gist I do know is that Ian Golden at some point used to be the race director for Virgil Crest ultras (under Red Newt Racing), but I believe retired the race due to a drop in interest in the race. That phrasing is a bit misleading, as I think it was more that there weren't enough people signing up for the race to justify the amount of work there is to put it on each year. The race disappeared after 2015 until Happily Running picked it up and revived the race in 2021. As an aside, if you find yourself on the east coast sometime, check out the events put on by Happily Running and Red Newt Racing. Nichole, Vinny, and Ian are great people and deserve your support! You'll be in for a gnarly, tough race, but a fun time regardless of distance with a great community. It's worth it, and they deserve all the love they can get. 

Gushing aside, Virgil Crest is very hard. The 50 mile option has about 11,000ft of vert that comes mostly from a couple punchy climbs coming over a ski slope at Greek Peak and a few longer sustained climbs along the Finger Lakes Trail, or en route to the Finger Lakes Trail. The single track is awesome though! Not like "California Carpet" of the Sierra's and Marin Headlands, the Finger Lakes Trail tends to be very rooty with loose rocks with some eroded edges depending on where you're at. It's possible to get into a flow state, but you'll have to look at your feet for most of the day to not get tripped up (which I did gracefully ~10 times). 

The course is ran on 2 different loops:

1. The "Mountain" Side, which starts at Greek Peak and then runs the trails along Virgil Mountain behind the resort in a figure 8-esc fashion

and

2. The "Other" Side, which also starts at Greek Peak and then turns onto Carson Road to climb up to the Finger Lakes Trail and follows that for sometime. 

Some people absolutely love the "Other" side, and by some people I mean Vinny. I had ran that section a few weeks before the race after it had rained a ton and I felt that it was super easy to get turned around in. I spent a *ton* of time just trying to stay on the trail and got caught up by a few fallen trees. Thankfully the course was marked incredibly well along that section (though I did miss like one section of trail), and the fallen trees that could be taken care of, were. I think I can see why people do love this section, it's a bit mystical once you reach the trail. When I ran it, everything was wet, which gave it an eerie forest bog type of vibe. It feels like running through a fairy tale setting and at any moment you can find a witches hut, of which there is a somewhat ran down hikers shelter along the trail that does give off strong spoooooky vibes. The back half of the loop has a lot of vines growing along the trail. It makes the single track a bit claustrophobic but does feel much faster to gun through. 

I prefer the "Mountain" side. The long climb up the Finger Lakes Trail to get to the power lines is somewhat steep but enjoyable (until you have to do it a second time during the heat). In general the trail feels more spread out and fluid than the "other" side. I felt that once the initial climb to get up to the power lines is done, the rest of the loop is very runnable and fast. Joe's 8 aid station is well positioned in the loop after a hard first half to regain confidence before going out for the other portion of the figure 8 and then the return to Hurt Locker at the start/finish of the loop. 

## The Build Up

This is the first year since I've began my PhD that I've actually been able to put together a solid training block. I'm not sure if my coaches would agree or disagree, but this is probably the most solid year of effort I've dedicated to running since I ran Broken Arrow in 2021. I started my training block upon returning from Paris in April and have been consistently adding more mileage each month since. I was lucky to have been able to live in Truckee from April until the beginning of August, which really helped a ton in building my fitness. While I think April and May served as a re-introduction into running (and mountain running), I think I started to see major gains in my fitness overall around mid June. I ended up leaving Truckee at the end of July with a gnarly 21 mile run with about 5000' of vert, which I'm still super stoked about. That run proved to me that I can handle tough climbs, move consistently, and more importantly, that I was "in shape".

In August I moved back to Ithaca. I took the month off of work to de-stress, dive into training, and work on some personal things. I was consistent with my training overall, but the terrain was completely different. See, Ithaca has a lot of rolling hills with a mixed terrain of trail to road. It's a bit hard to go long in Ithaca without having some asphalt to run on, which is completely different than running in the Sierras. It's still enjoyable, and I had a few real solid weeks of effort in August. I pushed a little too hard at some point though and almost injured myself after a 77 mile week, but thankfully it ended up not being anything major. I believe I signed up for Virgil Crest at the end of August after running about 190 miles on the month.

I didn't have a huge taper for Virgil Crest in the weeks leading up to the race. I ran about 60 miles the week before the race, and then took race week super easy. When planning for Virgil, I tried to look a lot at the course profiles for both loops, and then really focused on my plan for nutrition during the race. It was a bit humorous as I was doing all this planning in my office on campus, while other grad-students were busy working. It's kind of a stark contrast to see someone doing calculations on some geochemical framework and then their neighbor considering race strategies instead of actual work. In short, my focus was to try and average an intake of about 80-90 grams of carbs, 300ish calories, and 900 milligrams of sodium each hour of the race. The rationale for this was to see how my gut would react to such an intake and to see if this would be a viable strategy for Rio Del Lago in November.

During race week, I was incredibly nervous. I hadn't ran a race since Modesto Marathon in 2022! The thing I was mostly struggling with was a lack of confidence in my ability to execute during the race. I knew I was in shape, but I didn't really know what kind of shape I was actually in. I had a goal time of initially between 9 to 10 hours, to which I changed to 10-11 hours the day before the race. This time would put me in contention to podium, if not win, which I have a hard time wrapping my head around. My goal time for Rio puts me in a similar situation, and it kind of terrifies me. I like to push myself and see what I can do, but I feel competing with myself is an entirely different mentality than competing against others. When I lay out goals that feel ambitious for myself, I get nervous that they may come off arrogant as I end up placing myself in a position to try and podium or win, when in reality I just want to know where the edge of my abilities go. I strongly define myself as a "quick" runner, someone who can run hard and well but is not "fast" like the crazy elites in the field. A classic case of the local joe who can throw down if need to, but if someone like an Eli Hemming, or a Rod Farvard were to come around, would absolutely be gassed. 

So I went into Virgil Crest, nervous, stressed, and excited, with the aim to work on 3 goals:

1. Test my fitness and see how my legs handle hard climbs on a long effort
2. Test my nutrition plan to see what I'd need to adjust before Rio rolls around
3. Try and keep it together enough to go sub 11 hours
