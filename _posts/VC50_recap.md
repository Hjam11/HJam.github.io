It's funny how you can have so many thoughts about a race but once you go to write them down, you have no clue what to say. Virgil Crest Ultras was a race I signed up for kind of last minute (about 2 to maybe 3 weeks out of race day), but had been on my radar for about 2 months. I was looking for a race to use in my build up for Rio Del Lago in November to test my overall fitness and see if I was still on track for my overall goals.
