It's funny how you can have so many thoughts about a race but once you go to write them down, you have no clue what to say. Virgil Crest Ultras was a race I signed up for kind of last minute (about 2 to maybe 3 weeks out of race day), but had been on my radar for about 2 months. I was looking for a race to use in my build up for Rio Del Lago in November to test my overall fitness and see if I was still on track for my goals. Virgil Crest 50 fit this aim for a few reasons. One, it's about 6 weeks out from Rio Del Lago. I felt that this gave me a good shot to push myself with ample time to recover should I blow up at the race and need more time to entirely recoup. Two, I haven't 'raced' an ultra marathon or even a marathon since I started grad school. Putting myself back into a position to race before Rio felt important to shake out the cobwebs and to (hopefully) gain some confidence. Third, and somewhat related to two, I often times feel like I don't even know what I'm doing when it comes to setting my goals and shooting for them when it comes to running. Maybe I just lack confidence, but I have no clue how hard it is to run 100 miles in 18 hours. To be honest, that goal for Rio felt fast, ambitious, but attainable (a 'goal' if you will lol). I don't know if it is going to be a stretch with my fitness to run that time or if that is well within my wheelhouse. My goals for both Rio and Virgil revolve around time, but those times historically have lead to podium finishes at both of these events. That intimidates me. I don't think of myself as a very fast runner. A quick runner, yes, but out of my element when competing with those going for podiums and wins. It is a different mentality to compete against other runners than it is to solely compete against yourself.

Because of this, I was incredibly nervous heading into Virgil Crest. I wanted to finish between 10 to 11 hours, which would not only place me on the podium, but most likely give me a chance at winning the race. I'm still not sure if I was more nervous for going against competition, or if it's more that being in the front of the pack can be a bit isolating. I knew at some point in this race I was going to suffer, but the idea of suffering alone for 50 miles was daunting. To be brief, I luckily didn't have to suffer alone for most of the race; and, I left the race a lot more confident for Rio Del Lago than I was heading into Virgil. There's a lot I think I should be proud of with Virgil Crest, and a lot I should be weary of with regards to Rio Del Lago. I'll try and break the race down into sections:
