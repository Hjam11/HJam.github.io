## Introduction

Understanding controls on chemistry in streams has been a key focus of research in Critical Zone science for some time now. While a growing understanding has emerged pointing towards water-rock interactions as a primary control on stream water chemistry, both the fields of hydrology and low temperature geochemistry have different reasons as to why. 

In general, for hydrology, groundwater ages tend to correlate with differing chemical compositions. The longer the age, the more the water looks like the bedrock, while younger ages tend to look more like soil waters. A key implication of this is the coupling of groundwater ages with depth (though it does become more complicated than just that). As for the geochemical perspective, chemical weathering of bedrock is a reaction that takes time to reach equilibrium with the surrounding water. If groundwater interacts with bedrock for enough time, then the groundwater chemistry will reflect the chemistry of the minerals weathering into the water. However, if the timescale of the interaction is short, then the minerals in the bedrock will not fully reach equilibrium. 

Here, we are attempting to look at geochemical tracers and groundwater ages to see how well both correlate with regards to controlling observable stream chemistry
