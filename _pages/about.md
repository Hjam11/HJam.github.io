Hello! I'm a PhD student in geological sciences at Cornell University. I study low temperature geochemistry, but I'm more of a isotope eco-hydrologist. Much of my current work focuses on the Finger Lakes of New York, but my past work focused heavily on the isotopic signatures of groundwater and vadose zone water at the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, as well as the variance in these signatures in different tree species. 

I'll update more later, but feel free to take a look around!
