Hello! I'm a PhD student in geological sciences at Cornell University. I study low temperature geochemistry, but I'm more of a isotope eco-hydrologist. My current project is focused on disentangling climate signals across the Finger Lakes in central New York, but soon I'll begin working on building a transit time distribution model for a watershed in northern California! 

If you're interested in my current projects/focus, please check out my projects tab!
