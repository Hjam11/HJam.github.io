Hello! I'm a 2nd year PhD student in geological sciences at Cornell University. I study low temperature geochemistry, with a particular focus on the use of isotopes as tracers for silicate weathering, and hydraulic responses to evolving precipitation regimes! 

Currently I'm between 2 projects:
1. Detecting hydraulic responses to increased rainfall and decreased snowfall across the Finger Lakes watershed in Central New York
2. Using silicate weathering tracers to elucidate the link between groundwater residence times and reaction rates in the subsurface within a montane catchement in the Central Sierra Nevada

If you're interested in learning more, please check out my projects tab!
