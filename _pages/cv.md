Here is a copy of my most recent [CV](/files/HJ_CV_08282023.pdf).

Education
======
* B.A. in Environmental Earth Science, University of California: Berkeley, 2020
* Ph.D in Low Temperature Geochemistry, Cornell University, 2027 (expected)

Research Interests
======
* Isotopic Geochemistry 
* River Solute Fluxes
* Stable Isotope Hydrology 
* Groundwater Age Dating

Field Experience
======
* Western Australia (Jan 2024)
  * Collected acidic brines from a series of ephemeral lakes in Western Australia
  * Lead groundwater sampling of boreholes for geochemical analysis
  * Used multi-parameter probe to record in-situ chemistry of lake/groundwater at point of collection

* Sagehen Creek, CA, USA (July-August 2024, June-July 2023)
  * Collected stream and spring samples across Sagehen Creek watershed for geochemical analysis
  * Sample collection focused during snowmelt season (April-August)
  * Used multi-parameter probe to record in-situ chemistry of streams/springs at point of collection

* Finger Lakes, Central NY, USA (2022-2024)
  * Collected surface water samples of the 11 Finger Lakes across Central New York in summer and winter conditions
  * Collected stream samples of Cascadilla Creek at Cornell University at daily to weekly scales
  * Analysis focused on geochemical parameterization of surface waters and stream in order to constrain seasonal variability and response to different precipitation types

* Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, CA, USA (2018-2022)
  * Collected groundwater, stream, and vadose zone water samples for geochemical analysis
  * Recorded CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gas concentrations across vadose zone
  * Collected xylem samples of various tree species for δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H analyses
  * Recorded neutron density measurements of boreholes with a neutron probe to record moisture profiles

Work experience
======
* January 2021 - July 2022: Laboratory and Field Technician, Eel River Critical Zone Observatory
  * Served as primary manager of field sampling, sample storage and data organization for the Eel River CZO on multiple long-term research projects, including: collection of tree cores/twigs and water samples from the vadose zone and groundwater for δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O isotopic analysis; collection of samples for carbon stable isotopes, cations, anions, organic acid, pH and alkalinity, total carbon, total nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen
  * Analyzed isotopic data for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes with R. Reported progress on sample collection and processing on a weekly basis to the lead PI, and distributed data among a team of 5 other PIs and 4 graduate students regularly.
  * Ordered field and laboratory supplies, contacted suppliers to fix/troubleshoot equipment errors and worked with project members to catalog each sample collected as a part of the Eel River CZO program from 2015-2021

* August 2018 - January 2021: Student Research Assistant, Eel River Critical Zone Observatory
  * Assisted the field technician at for the Eel River CZO.
  * Collected tree cores/twigs for cryogenic extractions.
  * Extracted water from samples using the cryogenic extraction method and prepped water samples for infrared mass spec analysis at the Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry at UC Berkeley.
  * Managed and regularly entered data into project database.
  * Distributed data among 5 PIs and 4 graduate students and presented updates on field work and lab work to project members during monthly meetings and annual retreats.
  * Analyzed isotopic data in R.
