Here is a copy of my most recent [CV](/files/HJ_CV_03172023.pdf).

Education
======
* B.A. in Environmental Earth Science, University of California: Berkeley, 2020
* Ph.D in Low Temperature Geochemistry, Cornell University, 2027 (expected)

Research Interests
======
* Isotopic Geochemistry 
* River Solute Fluxes
* Stable Isotope Hydrology 

Work experience
======
* January 2021 - July 2022: Laboratory and Field Technician, Eel River Critical Zone Observatory
  * Served as primary manager of field sampling, sample storage and data organization for the Eel River CZO on multiple long-term research projects, including: collection of tree cores/twigs and water samples from the vadose zone and groundwater for dD and d18O isotopic analysis; collection of samples for carbon stable isotopes, cations, anions, organic acid, pH and alkalinity, total carbon, total nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen
  * Analyzed isotopic data for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes with R. Reported progress on sample collection and processing on a weekly basis to the lead PI, and distributed data among a team of 5 other PIs and 4 graduate students regularly.
  * Ordered field and laboratory supplies, contacted suppliers to fix/troubleshoot equipment errors and worked with project members to catalog each sample collected as a part of the Eel River CZO program from 2015-2021

* August 2018 - January 2021: Student Research Assistant, Eel River Critical Zone Observatory
  * Assisted the field technician at for the Eel River CZO.
  * Collected tree cores/twigs for cryogenic extractions.
  * Extracted water from samples using the cryogenic extraction method and prepped water samples for infrared mass spec analysis at the Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry at UC Berkeley.
  * Managed and regularly entered data into project database.
  * Distributed data among 5 PIs and 4 graduate students and presented updates on field work and lab work to project members during monthly meetings and annual retreats.
  * Analyzed isotopic data in R.

Teaching
======
* TA for EAS 3030 'Intro to Biogeochemistry' : Fall, 2022
  * Ran discussion sections and review sessions for midterms
  * Graded homeworks, midterms, and finals
  * Held multiple office hours each week to help students with material
  * Gave lecture on Oxygen and Hydrogen Stable Isotopes
* TA for EAS 2250 'The Earth System' : Spring, 2023
  * Held and graded lab sections 
  * Had office hours for students 
  
Skills
======
* Proficient in using R to manage datasets and make plots relevant to ongoing projects
  * ggplot2
  * dplyr
  * lubridate

* Confident in troubleshooting and solving equipment errors in field and laboratory settings

* Experienced in planning multi-day field campaigns to collect various types of samples for environmental monitoring and biogeochemical research

* Able to incorporate new fieldwork tasks efficiently to maintain consistent data collection

* Understanding on how to use micropipettes, systems under vacuum, liquid nitrogen, cryogenic extractions for IRMS analysis, and acid baths to clean equipment for the field.
